# tnhScript 3

This is tnhScript 3 for **Thief 2**, but also **System Shock 2** and other
games using the **NewDark** engine with `squirrel.osm`. The custom scripts
have been required for many fan-missions in their own OSM package. You can
now make use of these scripts freely as the Squirrel language versions are
licensed under the GNU General Public License.

You must install the script by copying the `.nut` file to the `sq_scripts`
folder for your mission. Then load `squirrel.osm` which is included with
since the 1.25 version of **Thief 2**. 

The `tnhScript.nut` file is built from the source files with the tool
`make.cmd`. This requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) but it can be
emulated by simply copying the individual sources into a single file.

You may edit and distribute copies of tnhScript as long as you license
your derivative scripts under the GPL and provide a download location
of the modified version.

The script documentation for fan-mission authors is hosted online at 
The Dromesday Book. Please go to http://dromed.whoopdedo.org/tnhscript/index
to learn how you can use custom scripts in your missions. _Not all scripts
from the original tnhScript will be converted to Squirrel language._
